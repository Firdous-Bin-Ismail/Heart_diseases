# ML_Project_02
I used better techniques to explore the data and also for pre-processing in this project.

I applied 5 different models to get a better result.

*** I implemented and compared 5 different classification models:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3. Naive Bayes

4. Decision Tree Classifier

5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
